	The NCRAM mmio device

1. Overview
----------------

NCRAM is non-cacheable RAM which provides non-cacheable
shared memory buffers for I/O devices and the processor
threads to exchange information.    I/O devices can 
write into this memory by DMA, and the processor can
then read/write from the memory in the usual way.  
The non-cacheable nature of the NCRAM ensures that cache 
coherency in the processor will not need to be enforced at 
the IO->NCRAM level.

2. NCRAM is treated as an mmio device.
----------------------------

The NCRAM is treated as a memory mapped IO device
in the CORTOS2 system configuration.

3. NCRAM memory realization
----------------------------

The NCRAM is physically distributed across main memory
and possibly in I/O devices.  This is transparent to
the user.

4. NCRAM driver
---------------------------

The NCRAM driver provides three routines
	- initialization
		the allocation region is defined by
		a virtual page, physical page identifier
		and the number of buffers to be managed.
	- allocation
		allocation will be 1 buffer at a time, with a fixed
		buffer-size (for now) of 2048 bytes.  The virtual
		and physical addresses of the allocated buffer are
		returned (along with status).
	- deallocation
		1 buffer at a time.  The virtual address is used
		to identify the buffer to be freed.

5. Notes
-----------------------------

Note that the allocator needs to know the virtual address
of the region (used by software) as well as the physical
address of the region (used by the high speed I/O devices
 such as a NIC).
