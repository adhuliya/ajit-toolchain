1.	enable_serial / enable_serial_with_interrupt
		options.

2.      Issue in printing core id in logging.

3.      bget_nc should return null if not enough nc ram.

4.      replace ee_printf with different print routine..
		e.g. printf_?

5.      use larger page sizes when creating vmap whenever
	possible??
		note: the TLBs for level 3 pages are very
			big (256 entries) so this is not
			very urgent.

6.      multiple ncram, mmio regions.

7.      gc sections option.

6.      user-mode versus supervisor mode in application..
		Note: only the asr reads need to be in supervisor
			mode, and we have a way to trap to
			supervisor to read the asr...

		supervisor instructions
			write/read asr/psr/wim/tbr  etc.
			lda/sta

		equivalent of ioctl?
