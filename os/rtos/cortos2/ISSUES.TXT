1.	enable_serial / enable_serial_with_interrupt
		options.

2.      Issue in printing core id in logging.

3.      bget_nc should return null if not enough nc ram.

4.      user-mode versus supervisor mode in application..
		Note: only the asr reads need to be in supervisor
			mode, and we have a way to trap to
			supervisor to read the asr...

		supervisor instructions
			write/read asr/psr/wim/tbr  etc.
			lda/sta

		equivalent of ioctl?
