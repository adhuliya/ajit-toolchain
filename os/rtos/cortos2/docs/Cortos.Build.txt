	How Cortos2 uses the YAML file to produce
		executable code.


1. Overview

	YAML and source code specified in YAML file
	are used to produce the executable image.

	Cortos2 does the following:
		- figures out a virtual to physical mapping
			with appropriate protection.

			- allocates space for dynamic memory allocation pools
				(cacheable, non-cacheable)
			- allocates space for stacks needed by hardware
				threads in the system.
			- creates linker script files for combining
				the modules in the program.
			- adds barrier/guard pages to detect stack overflow.

		- initializes the processor run-time environment before
			passing control to user code.
