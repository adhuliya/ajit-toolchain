	Introduction to CORTOS2
	


1. Motivation
--------------

	Quickly develop and deploy lightweight embedded
	applications in the AJIT processor ecosystem.

	Concept:
		1. provide an abstract of the platform.
		2. allow the user to specify how her software
		    fits into the platform.


2. Platform 
-------------

	Processor configuration
		AJIT multi-core multi-threaded processor:
		number of cores, number of threads per core,
			isa of threads in core.

	Memory configuration
		flash, sram, ncram, mmio regions
			(RXWC protection)

	Devices
		scratch, timer, serial, i2c, spi
			 (these are hardcoded for now))
		

3. Software 
--------------

	Startup-routine for thread 0,0

	Static workload per thread
		sequence of routines to be executed 
		by thread 

	Stack configuration
		amount of stack per thread.

	Interrupt service routine assignment
		allow a user  to specify routine for each interrupt.

	Software trap service routine assignment
		allow a user to specify routine for each sw trap.

	Locks
		cacheable, non-cacheable (ncram)

	Queues
		cacheable, non-cacheable (ncram).

	Dynamic memory allocator
		cacheable, non-cacheable (ncram).
		
	Logging

	
4. Other "packages"
--------------------

	protothreads


5.  Planned 
-----------------------
	pre-emption, posix threads.
