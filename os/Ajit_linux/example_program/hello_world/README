This is an example program for Ajit_linux system.

Prerequisites:
        - ajit-toolchain
        - ajit_env is sourced, giving access to available tools

Step 1: Run compile.sh; this cross-compile your program with sparc-linux-gcc
Step 2: Run copy.sh; this copy the corresponding executable/binary to the Overlay directory

After the above steps are successfully performed, we can proceed with Ajit_linux build.
