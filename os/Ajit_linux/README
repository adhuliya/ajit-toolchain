BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------
	To build the OS, run

		./GeneratememMapForAjit.sh <DEFCONFIG>

		DEFCONFIG values
		    <1> rootfs-tmpfs with satic-lib & static device list
		    <2> legacy initramfs system config;no rootfs-tmpfs present [HAS THE LATENCY FIX]

	followed by

		./vmLinuzToMemmapAtf0004000.sh

	Note: paths to the bin-utils must be setup before doing this.
	Note: device-tree-compiler needs to be installed.
	Note: by default clock frequency is set for c-mode in the device-tree. 
		Refer "Ajit_device_tree/README" for knowing how to switch it for FPGA.

Ajit Linux System:
------------------
Overview
========

	Ajit Linux is based on Linux 3.16.1. Major additions for the Ajit platform are
		- Ajit_irq: The interrupt handling in lieu with Ajit interrupt handler. 
				Board-specific routines for handling timer and serial interrupts 
				and linking them with the kernel.
		- Ajit_serial: Driver for Ajit serial device
		- Ajit_srmmu: Ajit cache and tlb flush/read operations
		- A set of architecture specific code modifications in "/arch/sparc" subdirectory

	For detailed overview, please refer "Documentation/README". "AJITREFS.txt" provide diff of the modifications. 

Adding files to Linux image
===========================

Buildroot, the build system we use, has a feature to add files on target filesystem.

	Ajit Linux contains uClibc, which is a C library implementation. Following are the 
	steps to be followed for creating an Ajit Linux image that contain a custom program binary.
		- write your program and compile it using the cross-compile tools provided along with this project.
		Keep in mind of the libc present in Ajit Linux
		- place your binary in "Ajit_buildroot_configs/board/rootfs/overlay/home"
		- make the binary an executable for convenience
		- Follow the build process as described in "Building an Ajit Linux Image" section

	The resulting image will have the custom binary in "/home" directory. Once the image in booted in your 
	target, which will be the C-model or FPGA, navigate to "/home" and run the binary as usual.

	An example program setup is provided at "example_program/hello_world".

	Note: If you choose to build with option <2>, then place the binary at "Ajit_buildroot_configs/board/overlay/rootfs/home"
	Note: "ajit_env" must be setup properly
