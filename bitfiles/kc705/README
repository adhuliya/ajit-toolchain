This test design interfaces AJIT core with SPI flash and DRAM. 

The flash is assigned addresses 0x0-0x3FFFFFFF.
The SRAM is assigned addresses 0x40000000-0xFFFFFFFF

Tests:
Pass .bin file to Program Device utility in Hardware Manager in Vivado.
First program the flash memory with the .bin file.
Use ajit_debug_monitor to read flash contents. Also reset processor.


SPI FLASH device used is mt25ql128-spi-x1_x2_x4  from Micron.
