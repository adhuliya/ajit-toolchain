This is the multi-core multi-thread C model for AJIT processor systems.

An AJIT multi-core multi-thread system consists of up to 4 cores,
each of which can have either 1 or 2 threads.

The threads in a core are identical, and  can support either the plain 
SPARC-V8 32-bit ISA or the AJIT extended 64-bit ISA.


The components of the C model

	bridge/
		coherent memory switch
		stitching together the cores.

	cache/
		model for dcache and icache.
		VIVT caches with synonym elimination
		and cache coherency related invalidation.


	cpu/
	cpu_interface/
		Model of the AJIT thread (called the CPU earlier).

	debugger/
		AJIT thread debug infrastructure.  Each thread can
		be connected to a GDB client.


	devices/
		Timer, serial, interrupt controller.

	mmu/
	tlbs/
	rlut/
		memory management unit, tlbs, rlut (for synonym elim and cache coherency)

	half_precision_float/
		library for half precision operations.

	memory/
		memory array model.

	monitorLogger/
		trace logging.

	common/
		shared code.

	testbench/
		the executable is in bin/ inside this folder.

	SConscript
	SConstruct

	docs/
		useful docs.  See the figure.
