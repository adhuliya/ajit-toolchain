1. Overview

	The debug utility functions provide a simple C interface
	to perform debug functions with the CPU.  To debug the
	CPU, you must set

		ENV_to_AJIT_reset := 2 

	so that the CPU-CCU is idle, while the MIU and TEU are
	still active.

	Debug commands can be single/double/triple word commands.
	The first word is always a command word, and the second
	and third words are data words.

	Debug responses are always a single word, either
	data or error-code.

2.  First command word format

	length	op-code  command-data
	8        8         16

	The top-eight bits specify the length (can be 1,2,3).
	The next 8 bits specify the op-code.  For each op-code
	the 22-bit command data is interpreted differently.

	The possible op-codes are

	label                 value       
	DBG_READ_IUNIT_REG    1   	 1-word-command 
	DBG_WRITE_IUNIT_REG   2		 2-word-command
	   for these two commands, the command-data is interpreted as follows
		   15:11     10   9   8   7  6  5  4:0
		   win-ptr  reg  psr wim tbr y asr reg-id

	  If the reg bit is set, 
		then one of the 32-bit general purpose 
          	registers is accessed (as specified by reg-id)
	  Else If the asr bit is set, 
		then one of the 32-bit ancillary state 
          	registers is accessed (as specified by reg-id)
	  Else if the psr bit is set, 
		the PSR is accessed 
	  etc.

	DBG_READ_FPUNIT_REG      3	1-word-command
        DBG_WRITE_FPUNIT_REG     4	2-word-command
	   for these two commands, the command-data is interpreted as follows
		15:6    5      4:0
               unused  fsr     reg-id
	
	If the fsr bit is set,
		the fsr is accessed 
	Else
		the fp-reg[reg-id] is accessed.


	DBG_READ_MEM		   6 	2-word-command
	DBG_WRITE_MEM		   7	3-word-command
	 	for these two commands, the command-data is interpreted as follows
		 15:12     11:8     7:0
		unused     bytes    asi

		All mem-accesses will be through dcache, except the 
		one corresponding the flush-icache operation.

 	DBG_SET_BREAK_POINT    	   8		all are 2-word commands
        DBG_REMOVE_BREAK_POINT     9 
	DBG_SET_WATCH_POINT        10
	DBG_REMOVE_WATCH_POINT     11 
	 	for these four commands, the command-data is interpreted as follows
		  15:4      3:0
		unused     reg-id
		
		Upto 16 break-point and watch-point registers are supported.
		(Note: not yet implemented).


	
	DBG_EXECUTE_INSTRUCTION  12  		2-word command
		command data is unused.

	DBG_READ_CONTROL_REG	13  	1-word command
	for this command, the command-data is interpreted as follows
		15:3    1      0
        unused  npc     pc

	DBG_CONNECT	14  	1-word command
	DBG_DETACH	15  	1-word command
	DBG_CONTINUE	16	1-word command

	DBG_READ_CPUNIT_REG	17	1-word-command
        DBG_WRITE_CPUNIT_REG	18	2-word-command
	To read / write to the Co-processor registers

2.  Second command word 

	- specifies register value for all register writes (include set break/watch points)
	- specifies address for all memory accesses.
	- specifies instruction for exec-instruction.

3. Third command word
	- specifies data for memory writes.
