  The ../include/spi.h and ../src/spi.c files provide
  an interface to an SPI master device for the aggregator.

  Each SPI master device is tied to a pair of pipes, 
  a 16-bit command pipe and an 8-bit response pipe.

  The 16-bit commands have the following format
  
  15  14:11   10        9:8      7:0
  1   0000    r/wbar   reg-id   data.

  and specify a read/write operation to one of four
  registers in the SPI master used in the AJIT processor
  (see AJIT_PROJECT_HOME/processor/vhdl/spi/master/README).
