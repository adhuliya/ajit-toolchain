A simple client/server which sort of
works.

1. Test 1
	start 
		../bin/server 9998 
		../bin/client 9998 
	as two separate processes.

	Lines typed in client shell will
	be received by server and reflected
	back to the client.

2. Test 2

	start 
		../bin/server 9998 

	and in another shell start

	nc  127.0.0.1 9998

	Now in the nc window you should
 	see a prompt

	%

	Type a line after the prompt and the
	line should get reflected back to the nc
	window 

	A cheap console.
