1. Overview

	The debug utility functions provide a simple C interface
	to perform debug functions with the CPU.  To debug the
	CPU, you must set

		ENV_to_AJIT_reset := 2 

	so that the CPU-CCU is idle, while the MIU and TEU are
	still active.

	Debug commands can be single/double/triple word commands.
	The first word is always a command word, and the second
	and third words are data words.

	Debug responses are always a single word, either
	data or error-code.

2.  First command word format

	length	op-code  command-data
	8        8         16

	The top-eight bits specify the length (can be 1,2,3).
	The next 8 bits specify the op-code.  For each op-code
	the 22-bit command data is interpreted differently.

	The possible op-codes are

	label                 value       
	DBG_READ_IUNIT_REG    1   	 1-word-command 
	DBG_WRITE_IUNIT_REG   2		 2-word-command
	   for these two commands, the command-data is interpreted as follows
		   15:11     10   9   8   7  6  5  4:0
		   win-ptr  reg  psr wim tbr y asr reg-id

	  If the reg bit is set, 
		then one of the 32-bit general purpose 
          	registers is accessed (as specified by reg-id)
	  Else if the psr bit is set, 
		the PSR is accessed 
	  etc.

	DBG_READ_FPUNIT_REG      3	1-word-command
        DBG_WRITE_FPUNIT_REG     4	2-word-command
	   for these two commands, the command-data is interpreted as follows
		15:6    5      4:0
               unused  fsr     reg-id
	
	If the fsr bit is set,
		the fsr is accessed 
	Else
		the fp-reg[reg-id] is accessed.


	DBG_READ_MEM		   6 	2-word-command
	DBG_WRITE_MEM		   7	3-word-command
	 	for these two commands, the command-data is interpreted as follows
		  15:8      7:0
		 unused      asi

		All mem-accesses will be through dcache, except the 
		one corresponding the flush-icache operation.
		
		TODO: use 15:8 to supply a byte-mask...

 	DBG_SET_BREAK_POINT    	   8		all are 2-word commands
        DBG_REMOVE_BREAK_POINT     9 
	DBG_SET_WATCH_POINT        10
	DBG_REMOVE_WATCH_POINT     11 
	 	for these four commands, the command-data is interpreted as follows
		  15:4      3:0
		unused     reg-id
		
		4 break-point and watch-point registers are supported.



	DBG_CONNECT	14  	1-word command
		Must be used to connect with processor when it
		is started in debug mode.

	DBG_DETACH	15  	1-word command
		To detach the processor from the debug connection.
		Processor will continue with last value of PC,NPC,PSR
		that  was updated by the debug connection.

	DBG_CONTINUE	16	1-word command
		To continue the processor after a break/watch point hit.
		Processor will continue with last value of PC,NPC,PSR
		that  was updated by the debug connection.

	Note: new commands added to provide control of the
		processor using the debug interpreter.

	DBG_WRITE_RESET        24    1-word-command
				     command-data is interpreted as 
				     15:4         3:0
				     unused  reset-value 

	DBG_WRITE_INIT_PC      25    2-word-command
	DBG_WRITE_INIT_NPC     26    2-word-command
	DBG_WRITE_INIT_PSR     27    2-word-command

	DBG_READ_INIT_PC       28    1-word-comand
	DBG_READ_INIT_NPC      29    1-word-comand
	DBG_READ_INIT_PSR      30    1-word-comand
	DBG_READ_MODE          31    1-word-command

2.  Second command word 

	- specifies register value for all register writes (include set break/watch points)
	- specifies address for all memory accesses.
	- specifies instruction for exec-instruction.

3. Third command word
	- specifies data for memory writes.
