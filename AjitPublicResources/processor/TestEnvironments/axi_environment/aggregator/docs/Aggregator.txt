Notes on the aggregator data word format
Madhav Desai.
-------------------------------------------

The aggregator is responsible for conveying information
between the host testbench and the system implementation
in the FPGA prototoype.


From the host to the system, the following information
is forwarded:

  8-bit reset value

  8-bit console to serial data
  1-bit valid-signal for serial data

  8-bit debug-monitor to debug-interface data.
  1-bit debug-data-valid signal.

  This information is sent as a single 64 bit word.  The
  bit layout is as follows

   [63:32]  unused
   [31:24]  reset value
            This is an 8-bit value whose bit layout is as follows
                 [7:4] unused.

                 [3]  logger-flag:  if this bit is 1, the cpu will
                      generate a store and register-write trace.
			NOTE: in the current system implementation 
                              this is turned OFF

                 [2]  single-step flag: if this bit is 1, the cpu will
                      run a single instruction through the pipeline, one
                      at a time.
                      

                 [1]  debug-flag: if this bit is 1, the cpu will wait to connect to
                      the remote debugger via the debug-interface.
                 [0]  software reset: if this bit is 1, the cpu is reset, rest of system
                      is active.

 		Note:  you should typically use a reset value of 1 to reset the cpu
                       and 0 to let the cpu run in pipelined mode.  Bits 1,2 are useful
		       for debug.

	[23:16]  Serial-data.

	[15:8]   Debug-command

	[1]      Serial-data valid
			(when you are sending valid serial data, this bit must be set.  If
			  this bit is 0, the serial-data will be ignored).

	[0]	Debug-data valid
			(when you are sending a valid debug command, this bit must be set.  If
			  this bit is 0, debug-command will be ignored).


From the system to the host, the following information is sent back using
a 64-bit word.

	a 16-bit count value.	
		This value is incremented by 1 for every message sent from the system to
		the host.
	8-bit cpu-mode

	8-bit debug-response
	1-bit debug-response-valid bit.

	8-bit serial-data from system to console.	
	1-bit serial-data valid bit.


The  layout of the 64 bit word coming from the system to the host
is as follows:
	[63:48]  counter-value (increments for every message)
	[47:32]	 unused.
	[31:24]  cpu-mode. the following are legal values.
			       0x0  uninitialized.
                               0x1  reset-mode
			       0x2  run-mode
			       0x3  error-mode
	[23:16]  serial-data from system to console
	[15:8]   debug-response from system to console.

	[7:2]	 unused.	

	[1]	 serial-data valid.
			(see note above on use of valid bits)
	[0]	 debug-response valid.
			(see note above on use of valid bits)
