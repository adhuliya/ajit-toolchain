Floating Point Move Instructions
================================
fmovs	=>	Move
fnegs	=>	Negate
fabss	=>	Absolute Value

=================================
Essentially all instruction copies contents from souce to dest
but, fnegs compliments the sign bit and fabss clears the sign bit

note:-
=====
	To transfer multiple-precision value between f-registers, one "fmovs"
	instruction required per word to be transfered.

	If source and destination registers are diffrent, a double-precision
	negation (absolute value) is performed by and "fnegs" ("fabss") and an
	"fmovs" instruction. similerly quad-precision, will have "fnegs"
	("fabss") followed by 3 "fmovs" instructions. If souce and destination
	are same then no need of "fmovs" instruction for any precision.
