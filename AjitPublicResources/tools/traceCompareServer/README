traceCompareServer will listen on two to four ports
and compare the traces of activity reported by
the ports.

This eliminates the need to store huge files.

	./bin/traceCompareServer [-h] [-p port-name]+  [-n nbytes-to-be-compared] [-e error-limit]
  	-h: print help message.
  	-p port-name: port-to-listen-on (at least two, at most four).
  	-n nbytes-to-be-compared: number of bytes to be received in each step. (default=4)
		for a trace signature of 32-bits, use -n 4
  	-e error-limit: number of errors before quitting. (default=16)
		the error information is printed to stdout.
  	-c count-limit: number of items to be compared before quitting. (default=1024)

e.g. 
	./bin/traceCompareServer -p 9999 -p 9998 -n 4 -e 4 -c 100000000 > error.log

To use this server, start it as a separate process together
with the processes that are generating the traces.  Note that
the processes that are generating the traces can be on different
machines.  Each traced process must be supplied an IP address
and a port number to connect to on the traceCompareServer.

An example of such a trace-generator is available in the bin/
folder
	./bin/traceGen <ip-address> <port-number> 
	for example: ./bin/traceGen 127.0.0.1 9999
