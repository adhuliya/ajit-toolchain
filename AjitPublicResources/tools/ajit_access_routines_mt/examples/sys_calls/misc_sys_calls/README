An example which shows the operation of different system calls.
This machinery is useful when the application is to be run
in user mode.

The flow:

	put the processor in user mode

	use a user-level printf routine
	which invokes SW trap 14 to 
	access the cortos_vprintf function.

	read physical memory using system 
	trap 15 invoked via a system call.

	read ASR values using SW trap 16.		


	Some more user printf's.	

	Go to supervisor mode via SW trap 17.

	Some more printfs (but cortos_printf's)

	back to user mode

	Some more user printf's
