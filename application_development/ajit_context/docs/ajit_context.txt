A first cut implementation of getcontext and
setcontext which can lead us to co-routines
and to yield/resume structures in cooperative
multi-threading.

--------------------

	When getcontext is called, do the following
		- execute a save	
		- save all register windows in the context data structure.
		- save all status regs in the context data structure.
		- restore and return.

makecontext
