This folder contains simple asm tests for checking I and D caches.
For running these tests :

1. Compile the processor model with the settings given below.
(In processor/C/common/include/Ajit_Hardware_Configurations.h )
	
	#define USE_DUMMY_MMU		1
	#define USE_DUMMY_CACHES	0
	#define ICACHE_ENABLE_CACHING 	1
	#define DCACHE_ENABLE_CACHING  	1
	#define ICACHE_NUM_SETS		2
	#define DCACHE_NUM_SETS		2


2. Run do validation script to generate memory map files 
and run the AJIT vanilla binary with the memory map file 
so that cache hit/miss information is displayed at the end of simulation.
Compare the hits/misses with the results given in each *.s file.

Example:

$ AJIT_cpu_cache_mmu_testbench_vanilla compiled/CountHitsMisses/CountHitsMisses.mmap
