This folder contains the  program to test floating point operation in c with sparc specification as well as the host version of the program .

The program has been run for 1 million iterations in C model .Signature is generated.and matched.
The program is to be again to be checked in the FPGA for its validation(12/04/17)

The final signature  generated should match.

1. Run ./compile_host.sh to run host program.

2. Run ./compile_in_C.sh to run float program in C model

3. Run ./compile_in_FPGA.sh to run float program in FPGA model
