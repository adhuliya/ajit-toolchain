This folder contains the  program to test unsigned arithmetic operation in c with sparc specification as well as the host version of the program .

The program has been run for 10 million iterations in C model and 1 million iterations in FPGA model and signature is generated and matched.

1. Run ./compile_host.sh to run host program.

2. Run ./compile_in_C.sh to run unsigned operations in C model

3. Run ./compile_in_A.sh to run unsigned operations in Aa model

4. Run ./compile_in_FPGA.sh to run unsigned operations in FPGA model
