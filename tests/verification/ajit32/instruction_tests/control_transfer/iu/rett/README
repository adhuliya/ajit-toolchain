Tests for RETT:

RETT1.vprj is for testing non-trapping behavior
RETT2-6 are for testing trapping/error-causing behavior of RETT.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If rett does not cause a trap, it does the following :
	cwp = (cwp+1) mod NWINDOWS
	causes a delayed control transfer to target address
	makes S=PS
	sets ET in psr to 1

Traps/error conditions that can be caused by RETT:
	privileged instruction trap  (S=0, ET=1)
	illegal instruction trap     (S=1, ET=1)
	privileged instruction trap + error state (S=0, ET=0)
	window underflow trap + error state (ET=1, new_window=invalid)
	mem_addr_not_aligned trap (Et=1, addr[1:0]!=0)
