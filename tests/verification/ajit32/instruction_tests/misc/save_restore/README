save produces a window overflow trap if (cwp-1)modulo NWINDOWS points to an invalid window.
restore produces a window underflow trap if (cwp+1) modulo NWINDOWS points to an invalid window.

If a save/restore instruction does not trap, two operands are added and result is stored in destination register and cwp is updated.
