A program which can be used to characterize interrupt
overhead. A count-down timer is programmed to interrupt
the processor.  

The ISR keeps track of the interval from the last interrupt.
The timer is reinitialized by the ISR.  The count-down interval is set to 1ms.

This allows us to compute the min/max/avg, std-deviation of intervals 
between successive interrupts.
