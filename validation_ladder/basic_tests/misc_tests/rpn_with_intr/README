A RPN calculator which uses the serial device 
via interrupts.   You can ask the device to
evaluate RPN expressions that involve single 
digits and +,*,/,-.  Type 'q' to exit.

This example exercises the interrupt mechanism as well as the
serial peripheral.

See KC705Platform.log file to check output of
this program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.
		

	Generation date of the bitfile used for testing this program: 21 June

Usage for the KC705 Platform:
1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.

2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh
        script and pass the starting address of data and text
section along with the corresponding vmap file.
eg: ./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x40000000 0x40040000 VMAPHIGH.txt
or ./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x0 0x40040000 VMAPLOW.txt

3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script
with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
map of application at high memory and start.

4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
