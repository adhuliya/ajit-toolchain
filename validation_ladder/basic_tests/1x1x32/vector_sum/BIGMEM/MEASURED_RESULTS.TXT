This example illustrates the importance of having
a set-associative cache.

For a direct mapped cache: 
 main: start_time=11950447, end_time=22473308, elapsed=10522861

For a 4-way set associative cache:
 main: start_time=15851381, end_time=16839591, elapsed=988210

Direct mapped cache is 10.6X slower than the set associative cache!!

Set associative With 64KB L2 cache... performance is poorer
because the L2 cache is too small..
 main: start_time=21506075, end_time=22871181, elapsed=1365106
