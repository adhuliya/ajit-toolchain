10 iterations:    number-of-instructions-executed = 17060
20 iterations:    number-of-instructions-executed = 26816

number of instructions executed per iteration = (26817-17060)/10 = 976 instructions per iteration.

measured from hardware at 80MHz (April 20, 2023)
Elapsed time=      0.012622, MFLOPS=40.562889
		# of cycles = 0.012630*80000 = 1010

Therefore IPC = 976/1010 = 0.97 IPC   Not bad.

	Elapsed time=      0.012624, MFLOPS=40.558712

Almost the same performance.
