This test prints out the contents of ASR30 and ASR31 
registers which respectively hold the low(0-31) & high(32-63) 
value of the 64 bit cycle count, and performs this action in a loop.

See  KC705Platform.log file to check output of
this program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.
(low-> ASR30, high -> ASR31)

Usage for the KC705 Platform:
1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.

2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh
   script and pass the starting address of data and text
	 section along with the corresponding vmap file.
eg: ./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x40000000 0x40040000 VMAPHIGH.txt
	or ./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x0 0x40000000 VMAPLOW.txt

3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script
   with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
   map of application at high memory and start.

4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
   application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
