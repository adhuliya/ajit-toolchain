A program which can be used to characterize interrupt
overhead. A count-down timer is programmed to interrupt
the processor.  An ISR is used to set a flag which is
monitored from the main program. The timer is reinitialized
when the flag is observed to be set.  The count-down interval
is set to 1ms.

   This gives the min/max/avg, std-deviation of intervals between successive
   observations of the flag being set.
	
	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 5 June 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform:
  1.Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.

  2.Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh
  script and pass the starting address of data and text
		section along with the corresponding vmap file.
	eg: ./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x40000000 0x40040000 VMAPHIGH.txt
	or ./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x0 0x40000000 VMAPLOW.txt  
	3.Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script
    with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
    map of application at high memory and start.
  
	4.Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are runnin the
    application by burning a Bin file in the flash
