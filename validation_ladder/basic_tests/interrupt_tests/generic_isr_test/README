Illustrate the use of the new generic
interrupt handling scheme.

Things to note:
	In init.s, we first clear all stack 
	pointers, mark window 7 as invalid,
	give a valid stack pointer to window 7,
	set up the vmap, and switch to user
	mode before calling the main routine.


	In the user code,
		-initialize interrupt handler table.
		-write specific interrupt handlers.
		-insert specific interrupt handlers into
		  interrupt handler table.
