				/******* Observations from Xilinx's VC709 FPGA Card *******/

Started: clock freq=100 Mhz, NITERS=100000
Time per context-switch=0.000005 

	5us per context switch.

Jan 27, 2021 (after memory path latency reduction)

Started: clock freq=100 Mhz, NITERS=100000
Time per context-switch=0.000004

	4us per context switch.

Started: clock freq=80 Mhz, NITERS=100000
Time per context-switch=0.000006
	
	6 us per context switch (at 80MHz).
	This would be 5 us per context switch
		(increased memory latency path due to
			trace logger).
