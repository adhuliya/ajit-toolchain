Application that performs 4 context switches,
and times the difference taken for said 4 context
switches and returns the avg time taken.

	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 21 June 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
	
	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
		script along with starting addresses of instruction and data area
		the corresponding vmap file for those addresses as arguments.
		eg:
		./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x40000000 0x40040000 VMAPHIGH.txt
		or
		./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x0 0x40040000 VMAPLOW.txt

	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.
	
	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
