Performs a march test, switches context and 
performs another march test. This cycle is 
repeated several times so that the overhead
encountered for performing the context switches 
can be measured.

For checking the repetitive march tests with 
context switching, please provide the define 
string " -D SWITCH " in the compilation script.

To see the measurement without switching,
remove this define string from the script.

Note: For 24 iterations it takes about ~4 minutes 
on FPGA for the test to conclude. Increasing this 
number will increase the execution time.Default 
set to 24.


	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 21 June 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
	
	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
		script along with starting locations of text/instruction
		and data area and the corresponding VMAP file.S
	for eg.: 
		./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x40000000 0x40040000 VMAPHIGH.txt
	or  	./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x0 0x40040000 VMAPLOW.txt
	
	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.
	
	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
