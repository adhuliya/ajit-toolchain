A test that demonstrates a case of DCACHE LOAD MISS with non-cacheable data
addresses: CPU requests data, it is registered as a cache miss, request 
is passed to MMU, which fetches it from main memory, passes through DCACHE,
without storing it, and then suppies it to CPU.

Time taken for same operation but having the data already present in 
cache has advantage in terms of speed. 

See ../dcache_load_hit/KC705Platform.log for more.

The arrays are stored in distinct cache lines to avoid cache conflicts. 
Data locations(see vmap.txt) are marked as non-cacheable.

	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 30 Jan 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
		script
	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.
	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
