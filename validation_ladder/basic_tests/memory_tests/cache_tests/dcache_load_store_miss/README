A test that demonstrates a case of DCACHE LOAD-STORE MISS accesses with cacheable data
addresses

Time taken for same operation but having the data already present in 
cache has advantage in terms of speed. 

See ../dcache_load_store_hits/KC705Platform.log for more.

The arrays are kept in same cache lines to create cache conflicts. 
Data locations are marked as cached(see VMAPHIGH.txt and VMAPLOW.txt).

	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 21 June 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.

	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
	script along with starting addresses of instruction and data area
	the corresponding vmap file for those addresses.
		eg:
		./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x40000000 0x40040000 VMAPHIGH.txt
		or ./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x0 0x40040000 VMAPLOW.txt

	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.

	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
