A test that demonstrates a case of DCACHE LOAD-STORE HITS: CPU requests data, 
if present in cache already, it is passed to CPU without involving MMU.

While initialising arrays, the data for given addresses is stored in 
distinct cache lines. Data locations are marked as cached (see VMAPHIGH.txt and VMAPLOW.txt).

The values are later validated and numbers reported back.

	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 17 Jan 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
		script along with starting addresses of instruction and data area
		the corresponding vmap file for those addresses.
		eg:
			./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x40000000 0x40040000 VMAPHIGH.txt
	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.
	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
