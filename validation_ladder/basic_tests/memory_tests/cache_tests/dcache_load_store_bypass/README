A test that demonstrates a case of DCACHE LOAD and STORE BYPASS accesses.

The arrays are kept in distinct cache lines to avoid cache conflicts. 
Data locations accessed are marked as bypass.(see VMAPHIGH.txt and VMAPLOW.txt,
array location addresses not specified there.)

	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 21 June 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
	
	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
		script along with the starting address of instructions, Data
		and corresponding VMAP files. 
		for eg:
		./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x40000000 0x40040000 VMAPHIGH.txt

	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.
	
	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
