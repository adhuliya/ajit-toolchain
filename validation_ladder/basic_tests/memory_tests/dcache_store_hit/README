A test that demonstrates a case of DCACHE STORE HITs: CPU writes data
to main memory, through DCACHE via MMU.

To load the intended memory in D-cache lines, first they are filled up with 
NULL, and later values are filled in.

As these locations are in DCACHE before we execute step 2, DCACHE store hit occurs. 

 Data locations(see vmap.txt) are marked as cached.


	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 30 Jan 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
		script
	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.
	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
