A test which copies blocks of data
from one location to the other and
gives back the time taken to perform
this operation.

The source and destination arrays' location
is specified such that they do not create 
cache conflicts in the direct-mapped cache.


See KC705Platform.log file to check output of
this program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.


Usage for the KC705 Platform:
        1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
        2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh
                script
        3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script
                with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
                map of application at high memory and start.
        4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
                application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
