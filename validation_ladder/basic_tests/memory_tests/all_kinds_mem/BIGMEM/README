A test which checks the following types of
memory accesses using a simple march algorithm.
	- to cacheable pages
	- to non-cacheable pages
	- bypasses.

This setup is for the KC705 board which has
16MB flash at 0x0, and 128MB DRAM at 0x40000000

The compile script produces two memory maps, 
and a bootstrap.bin  file.   To run off flash,
write the bootstrap.bin file into flash and
boot from pc=0x0, npc=0x4.  To run off DRAM write the
all_kinds_mem.mmap.remapped to DRAM and
start at pc=0x40000000, npc=0x40000004
