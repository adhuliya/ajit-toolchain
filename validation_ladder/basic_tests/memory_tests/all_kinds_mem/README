A test which checks the following types of
memory accesses using a simple march algorithm.
	- to cacheable pages
	- to non-cacheable pages
	- bypasses.

You can decide where to place the text and data
sections.  In this directory there are two VMAP
files.

	a. VMAPLOWMEM.TXT
		place text at 0x0, data start at 0x8000.
		
		Compile script is invoked as (assuming 80MHz system):

		./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x0 0x8000 VMAPLOWMEM.TXT 80000000

	a. VMAPHIGHMEM.TXT
		place text at 0x40000000, data start at 0x4008000.
		
		Compile script is invoked as (assuming 80MHz system):

		./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x40000000 0x40008000 VMAPLOWMEM.TXT 80000000



	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 30 Jan 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
		script
	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.
	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.

See TODO to know further modifications to be done.
