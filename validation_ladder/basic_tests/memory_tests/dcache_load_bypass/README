A test that demonstrates a case of DCACHE LOAD BYPASS :
CPU requests data, DCACHE lookup and MMU translations are skipped.

Requested data supplied to CPU.

Time taken for same operation but having the data already present in 
cache has advantage in terms of speed. 
See ../dcache_load_hit/KC705Platform.log for comparison.

The arrays are stored in distinct cache lines to avoid cache conflicts. 
Data locations accessed are marked as bypass.(see vmap.txt)

	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 30 Jan 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
		script
	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.
	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.


TODO: self-checking within the program??
