A test that demonstrates a case of DCACHE STORE Misses with MMU lookup being
cacheable: CPU writes data to main memory, through DCACHE via MMU.

As the write locations are called for the first time ever, there wont be any
entries in the cache, leading to a cache miss.
 Data locations(see vmap.txt) are marked as cached.


	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 30 Jan 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
		script
	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.
	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
