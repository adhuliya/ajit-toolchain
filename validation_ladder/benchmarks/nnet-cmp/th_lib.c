 * function: th_timer_is_intrusive
 *
 * Description: 
 *			used to determine if the timer function is intrusive.
 *
 *          Intrusive usually means that operating and maintaining the timer
 *          has a run time overhead.  For example, using a 10ms interrupt
 *          to incriment a timer value is intrusive because the interrupt
 *          service routine takes CPU time.
 *
 *          If an intrusive target timer is used to measure benchmarks, then
 *          its effect must be measured and taken into account.
 *
 *          Some target timers may not be intrusive.  For example, a target
 *          with a built in real time clock can measure time without an
 *          interrupt service routine.
 *
 *          Another way to build a non-intrusive timer is to cascade
 *          counter/timer circuits to get very large divisors.  For example,
 *          with a 20mhz system clock two 16bit timers could be cascaded to
 *          measure durations up to 3 minutes and 34 seconds before rolling
 *          over.
 *
 * Note:
 *			If the timer is not avaialable, then this function returns
 *          FALSE.
 *
 *
 * Returns: 
 *			TRUE if the target's duration timer is intrusive
 *          FALSE if it is not

 * function: th_tick_granularity

 *          For example, the value returned by th_stop_timer() may be
 *          in milliseconds. In this case, th_ticks_pers_sec() would
 *          return 1000.  However, the timer interrupt may only occur
 *          once very 10ms.  So th_tick_granularity() would return 10.
 *
 *          However, on another system, th_ticks_sec() might return 10
 *          and th_tick_granularity() could return 1.  This means that each
 *          incriment of the value returned by th_stop_timer() is in 100ms

 * Description: 
 *			Signals the host that the test is finished

 *
 *          This function is called to signal the host system that the
 *          currently executing test or benchmark is finished.  The host

 *          timer (if one is available).  If the target does not have a timer,
 *          or it is not supported by the TH, then this function returns
 *          TH_UNDEF_VALUE.
 *
 * Note: 
 *			There are intentionally no parameters for this function.  It is

/* Function: th_crcbuffer
	Compute crc16 of a buffer. 

A CRC is calculated of an input buffer. 
Multiple buffer CRC checking is also supported for streaming 
output data. 

For a single buffer the input CRC MUST be 0, and the final 
CRC result is returned.

In the muliple buffer case, the input CRC is used as an intermediate
value for calculating the final CRC result.
The first buffer is passed with a inputCRC 
of 0 as in the single buffer case. The subsequent buffers are
passed with the CRC result of the previous buffer calculation. 

The caller must save the CRC result value and pass it 
back in inputCRC for the additional buffers.

The original usage is that this routine is called 
after a th_fsize and th_fread of a file into a buffer. The size and
buffer parameters are compatible with th_fsize and th_fread types.

Note: Addressability is not assumed, but the data is assumed 
to be unpacked. Packing can be 
handled by using crc16, or crc32 routines. A Local fix is allowed.
However, it is likely that other dependencies have already caused
the buffer to be unpacked. When porting, You must ensure that the buffer
is packed before applying a local fix. When calculating
CRC's on packed data, you may also 
have endian issues.

Params:
- inbuf
	Input buffer, usually e_u8* of data to CRC check.
- size
	Number of e_u8's to CRC.
- inputCRC
	Initial CRC value for inbuf. 0 for the first buffer.

	For multiple buffers, the CRC of the previous call must be used. The
	caller is responsible for saving this value.
- retval 
	CRC of inbuf based on inputCRC.
