A comparison of the performance of uclibc C string libraries and ajit string libraries is given below. The performance is checked at various lengths.

We compare the performance for each length, where it has looped over all the alignments at that length.
For eg-
        at length n - source was of length n at first iteration and dword aligned. But in the next iteration length is of  n-1 and it will be byte aligned. This loop runs 9 times to cover all alignments.

The table gives the number of clock cycles required by the ajit 64 bit string library compared to the 32 bit ones.
