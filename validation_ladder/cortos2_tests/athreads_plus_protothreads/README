An example illustrating a mixture of the athreads run-time
with protothreads.

The routine started by an athread can behave like a protothread 
and yield several times to implement true cooperative muti-threading
using a very light-weight mechanism.

The catch: strictly speaking the routine called by the athread should be
a static routine so that past memory is preserved. However this
requirement can be relaxed if the routine preserves the relevant state
in a data structure..
