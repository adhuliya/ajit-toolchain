Performance results for a64strcpy.

A comparison of the performance of strcpy and a64strcpy is given below. The performance is checked at various lengths.

We compare the performance for each length, where it has looped over all the alignments at that length. 
For eg-
	at length 800 - source was of length 600 at first iteration and dword aligned. But in the next iteration length is of 799 and iit will be byte aligned. This loop runs 9 times to cover all alignments.

The table gives the number of clock cycles required by the ajit 64 bit a64strcpy compared to the 32 bit strcpy.

	Length 		32bit 		64bit
	 576		16329 		6518
	 640		15027		7052
	 788		19378		9720
	 800		18645		8571
