A bare metal test of the timer interrupt.

The program sets up the timer and responds to the
interrupt. 

The compile script in the SMALLMEM directory use two constants (using -D)
   TIMERCOUNT
	(keep this 100 for the C model, and 100000 for the FPGA run).
   TIMERSAMPLES
	(keep this 10 for the C model, and 1024 for the FPGA run).
