8 threads.

All threads write to parts of a global array.
Thread T writes to elements T, T+8, T+16, ...

After all threads have completed their writes,
Each threads reads back all elements of the
global array and confirms the observed values.

This checks out the snoop invalidate mechanism
and also the invalidation sequencing (sort of).
