Tests for assembler, disaasembler and gdb for all instructions are here.
The tests are divided into different instruction types, refer paths.ods to check where the tests for each instruction is.

In each directory, the same fromat given below is followed-

1. To run these tests -
	cd directory
	source run.sh 

2. The components of each directory -
	a. data.py - This is a python dictionary, containing a list of all instructions and their corresponding opcodes, and also the number of expected occurences of each intruction after instruction genration.
	b. coutnt.py - This counts the occurences of all instructions and registers and compares it with the expected output.
	c. inst_genrate.py -This generates all possible combinations of all instructions given in the data.py dictionary.
	d. opcodes_generate.py - This reads the .s file and gives the expected object code for all instructions.
	e. extract.py - This extracts the object code from all the assembled, disassembled and gdb files.
	f. run.sh - Runs all of the above scripts and compares object codes of all four files ( expected, assembler, disassembler, gdb objectcodes).
