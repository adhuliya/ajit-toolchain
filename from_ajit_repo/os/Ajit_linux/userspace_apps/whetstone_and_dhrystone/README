The whet-dhry.bin file contains the AJIT Linux image with
following applications added externally:
1. ajittest
2. asecondtest
3. dhrystone
4. whetstone 

The Config and Makefiles for first two applications were
written by the team.
For the Dhrystone and Whetstone applications however, the required Config
and Makefiles came with the Buildroot setup under their 
'Debugging, profiling and benchmarking' target applications.
