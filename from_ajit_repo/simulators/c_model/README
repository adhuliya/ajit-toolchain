First setup pointer to Ahir release.
(Go to ahir release folder and source ahir_bashrc)

Then, go to the code/ directory, and type
   export AJIT_C_REF_MODEL=$(pwd)

In the code/ directory and type 
   scons

This should build the C model binary in testbench/bin.

OR 

" source build-C-model.sh "
   to build the C model with a single step.

If any libraries are missing or aren't linking,
go to that module's directory and run "scons"

for ex. if it complains about missing -lConsole ,
change directory to code/console and run "scons"
and back to code/ directory and run scons once more.
