Notes on alignment


	For writes
	----------


	Let us say the CPU initiates a 16-bit write.

	But this comes to the device as a 32-bit write
	with a byte-mask.


	Suppose I write the 16-bit quantity H to address
	0x0
	 
 	CPU will generate a write to address 0x0 with byte-mask 0xb1100
	so the top two bytes in the 32-bit word with address 0x0 will
	be filled with H 

	Suppose I write the 16-bit quantity H to address
	0x2

 	CPU will generate a write to address 0x0 with byte-mask 0xb0011
	so the bottom two bytes in the 32-bit word with address 0x0 will
	be filled with H 

	



	
	For reads
	----------

	Suppose the CPU initiates a 16-bit read.

	But this comes to the device as a 32-bit read
	with a byte-mask.

	Suppose CPU generates a read to address 0x0
	for a 16-bit quantity.
	
	So the read request from CPU will come with
	address=0x0, byte-mask 0xb1100

	So you read a 16-bit value from your register
	and put it in the upper half of the return 32-bit
	value.


	Suppose CPU generates a read to address 0x2
	for a 16-bit quantity.

	The read request from CPU will come with
	address=0x0, byte-mask 0xb0011


	So you read a 16-bit value from your register
	and put it in the bottom half of the return 32-bit
	value.
