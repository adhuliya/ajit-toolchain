From RTEMS
  
     In window T+1 there was an interrupt and we end
     up in window T.
   
     We save the required state for correct resumption
     in an interrupt stack.

     First: if window T is an invalid window, then
     we save to T-1, store its registers to stack
     and make T-1 invalid. 

     Now, back in window T:
           sp := fp - cpu_interrupt_frame_size
                             (some reasonable number)
           store important registers in T to sp.

     fp := sp
     sp := some-known-stack-location.


     etc.  ok got it.
