	The AJIT debug monitor utility
		Madhav Desai

1. Overview
	The AJIT debug monitor utility uses the
	hardware debug interface unit in the AJIT
	processor in order to control execution in 
	a system which uses the AJIT processor core.

	The architecture of the debug monitor utility is
	shown in the accompanying figure.  There are two
	connections from the user side to the processor
	model which need to be managed.   The first is
	a debug connection, and the second is a serial
	I/O connection.

	The AJIT debug monitor utility provides a shell which 
        serves as the debug connection.
	
	The Serial I/O connection with the processor model is routed
	to a console client over TCP/IP using a specified port.  
	A utility such as netcat (nc) can be used to setup a 
	terminal process that  uses this TCP/IP port.


2. Synopsys

	The AJIT debug monitor utility is invoked 
	at the command line 

	ajit_debug_monitor [-H] [-E] [-A] [-u <tty-dev>] [-v] [-c <console-port>]

	The options are
	-H  : optional, used when the processor core is modeled
		by a VHDL simulation.
	-E  : optional, used when the processor core is mapped
		to an FPGA card with a PCIE interface as the debug
		connection.
	-A  : optional, used when the processor core is modeled
		in C.
	-u <tty-dev> : optional, when the processor core is 
		mapped to an FPGA board, with a serial device (tty-dev)
		being used as the debug connection.
	-v : optional, print more information about what is going
		on in the background.  Also do read-after-write checks
		while downloading a memory map file (see the "m" command
		described later).
	-c <console-port> : optional, start console to listen on port
			console-port.   This option is relevant only 
			with the -H, -E and -A options.
		

3. Ajit debug monitor commands

	The AJIT debug monitor provides the user with a command
	shell.   The command prompt is 

	ajit> 

	For each prompt, the user can supply a command.  The
	commands are as follows:

	w rst <reset-val>
		Write reset-val to the 4-bit CPU reset input to
		the AJIT core.  The value must be a hex value,
		specified using the 0x format.
	
		e.g. 
			w rst 0x1
		puts the processor in reset mode, and
			w rst 0x0
		brings it out of reset.

	r mode 
		Read CPU mode.  This is a 4-bit value, and should
		have one of the following values

		value	meaning	
		0x0	uninitialized mode
		0x9     in reset mode.
		0x2     in normal run mode.
		0x3     in error mode.

	w ipc <init-pc-val>
		Set the initial PC at which the processor core starts
		when it comes out of reset.
		e.g.
			w ipc 0x40000000
		means the when the CPU comes out of reset,  the initial
		PC is 0x40000000.
	r ipc
		returns the value of initial PC.

	w inpc <init-npc-val>
		Set the initial NPC at which the processor core starts
		when it comes out of reset.
		e.g.
			w inpc 0x40000004
		means the when the CPU comes out of reset,  the initial
		NPC is 0x40000004.
	r inpc
		returns the value of initial NPC.

	w ipsr <init-psr-val>
		Set the initial PSR at which the processor core starts
		when it comes out of reset.
		e.g.
			w ipsr 0x10c0
		means the when the CPU comes out of reset,  the initial
		PSR is 0x10c0.
	r ipsr
		returns the value of initial PSR.

	w psr/wim/tbr/y <hex-value>
		Set the current value of one of PSR/WIM/TBR/Y registers
		to hex-value.

		e.g.
			w wim 0x1 
		sets the WIM value in the processor core to 0x1.

	r psr/wim/tbr/y 
		Read the current value of PSR/WIM/TBR/Y registers.

		e.g.
			r tbr
		returns the current value of the TBR.

	w asr <asr-id> <asr-value>
		Set the current value of one of ASR[asr-id] to asr-value.

		e.g.
			w asr 0x1  0xff
		sets the value of ASR[0x1]  to 0xff.

	r asr <asr-id>
		Read the current value of ASR[asr-id] register.

		e.g..
			r asr 0x1
		returns the current value of ASR[0x1].

	w iureg <reg-id> <reg-value>
		Set the current value of one of integer general purpose
		register [reg-id] to reg-value

		e.g.
			w iureg 0x7  0xff

		sets the value of R[0x7]  to 0xff.

	r iureg <reg-id>
		Read the current value of the  integer unit R[reg-id] register.

		e.g..
			r iureg 0xf
		returns the current value of R[0xf].

	w fpreg <reg-id> <reg-value>
		Set the current value of one of floating point general purpose
		register [reg-id] to reg-value

		e.g.
			w fpreg 0x7  0x10000000

		sets the value of F[0x7]  to 0x10000000.

	r fpreg <reg-id>
		Read the current value of the  floating point unit F[reg-id] register.

		e.g..
			r fpreg 0xf
		returns the current value of F[0xf].

	w mem <asi-value> <addr-value> <write-value>
		Write write-value to address addr-value in memory space defined by 
		asi asi-value.

		e.g.
			w mem 0xa  0x0 0xffffffff
		sets the value of mem[0x0] with asi=0xa  to 0xffffffff.

	r mem <asi-value> <addr-value>
		Read the current value of the  memory (identified by asi) location 
		addr-value.

		e.g..
			r mem 0xa 0x0
		returns the current value of mem[0x0], with memory defined by asi=asi-value.

	m <mmap-file> 
		load the memory map in mmap-file to the processor
		memory.

	s <script-file>
		execute the AJIT debug monitor commands listed in the script-file.

	q
		quit the monitor.

	h
		print a help message.

4. Setup
	We assume that the processor model is set up and ready to use.
	This means that one of the following situations is present:

	- The processor+system is mapped to an FPGA card, with the debug interface
		being mapped to PCIE (card must be in PCIE slot, FPGA must
		be programmed).
	- The processor+system is mapped to an FPGA card, with the debug interface
		being mapped to UART (card can be standalone, FPGA must be programmed).
		The reset switch inputs to the processor on the FPGA card  must be 0.
	- The processor+system is running in a VHDL simulation.  The debug connection
		is via a TCP/IP socket.
	- The processor+system are modeled by a C model (more precisely, an AA2C model).
		The debug connection is via the AHIR pipe-handler, which is linked
		to the processor model and the monitor.


5. Typical use cycle

	In typical use, one follows the sequence

		put the processor in reset (w rst 0x1)
		download the memory map (m <mmap-file>)
		set initial values for pc/npc/psr.
		release the reset (w rst 0x0)
		keep checking mode (r mode)
		on error mode, monitor internal state (r iureg etc...)	
		quit / go back to reset mode and try again.
