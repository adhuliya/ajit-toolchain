Overview
	We can use this script to multiple tests at once. It takes a .vprj file as input. 
	We need to write a vprj for each test, then, invoking this script would execute all examples.

Writing a .vprj file -

	1. SOURCES   - The source files required for compilation. 
	2. INCLUDES  - Files required to be included during compilation.
	3. DEFINES
	4. RESULTS   - Expected output (refer to docs/debug/post_condition_check/)
	5. CORES     - No of cores required for Cmodel.
	6. THREADS   - No of threads required for Cmodel.
	7. VERSION   - No of version required for Cmodel.

Command to be givem -

                validation_outer_env_v4.py [OPTIONS] [-t TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS] [-j JOBS_TO_RUN_IN_PARALLEL] [-E EXECCUTABLE_PATH] PATHS...
     
        OPTIONS
             -p: uses remmaped file while running C model, requires vmap.txt in same directory as vprj file

             -L: uses linkerscript present in same directory as vprj file, requires it to be named as Linkerscript.lnk 

             -l : Generate a log of register writes
                  The files are generated in trace_files/ folder
                   with extension .C_trace for C model and .Aa_trace for Aa model

             -s : Run in single-stepping mode
                    Relevant only for Aa/VHDL/FPGA model.

             -T : Generate a detailed trace of activity for each instruction 
                   The trace file is generated in trace_files/ folder
                    with extension .long_trace
                   (CAUTION : A trace file can get very large)

        CLEANUP:
             validation_outer_env_v3.py -c PATHS...
                   cleans up the compiled/ log/ and trace_files/ 
                   folders recursively from PATH
