Overview 
	Generates a trace file for all instructions executed. 

Introduction 
	A tracen file gives details such as updated flags, registers etc. for each executed instruction.


Generating the trace 

	 Use -w filename.wtrace option in Cmodel to create the trace


Reading the trace -


There are 4 parts in a trace 

1. PC (program counter). You can check the exact instrution at the PC in the objdump file.

2. Register-log - bits are as follows 

  31          flag to indicate that psr-has-been-updated.
  30          S
  29          PS
  28          ET 
  27:24       PIL
  23:20       CWP (4-bits)
  19          wim-updated
  18          tbr-updated
  17          y-updated
  16          GPR-updated
  15          0
  14          0
  13          double-word GPR update
  12:8        write-register-id
  7:0         register signature  calculated as xor of
                all written bytes from GPR, WIM, TBR, Y

3. Fp-reg log - bits are as follows

   31 write-fpreg-from-fp
   30 write-fpreg-from-ccu
   29 write-fsr-from-fp
   28 write-fsr-from-ccu
   27 write-fsr
   26 write-ftt
   25 write-fcc
   24 write-h-gpr
   23:21
       unused
   20:16
       write-reg-id
   15:8
       written-fsr-signature
   7:0 
       written-gpr-signature

4. Store log - bits are as follows

  returns 32-bit signature for store, based on supplied info.
  bits are as follows
  31          store-is-completed
  30          double-word-store
  29:24       asi (6 bits used).
  23:16       byte-mask
  15:8        address-signature
               xor of all bytes in address.
  7:0         data-signature
                xor of all bytes written.
