=== Recommended directory structure

When customizing Buildroot for your project, you will be creating one or
more project-specific files that need to be stored somewhere. While most
of these files could be placed in _any_ location as their path is to be
specified in the Buildroot configuration, the Buildroot developers
recommend a specific directory structure which is described in this
section.

Orthogonal to this directory structure, you can choose _where_ you place
this structure itself: either inside the Buildroot tree, or outside of
it using +BR2_EXTERNAL+. Both options are valid, the choice is up to you.

-----
+-- board/
|   +-- <company>/
|       +-- <boardname>/
|           +-- linux.config
|           +-- busybox.config
|           +-- <other configuration files>
|           +-- post_build.sh
|           +-- post_image.sh
|           +-- rootfs_overlay/
|           |   +-- etc/
|           |   +-- <some file>
|           +-- patches/
|               +-- foo/
|               |   +-- <some patch>
|               +-- libbar/
|                   +-- <some other patches>
|
+-- configs/
|   +-- <boardname>_defconfig
|
+-- package/
|   +-- <company>/
|       +-- Config.in (if not using BR2_EXTERNAL)
|       +-- <company>.mk (if not using BR2_EXTERNAL)
|       +-- <boardname>/
|           +-- package1/
|           |    +-- Config.in
|           |    +-- package1.mk
|           +-- package2/
|               +-- Config.in
|               +-- package2.mk

+-- Config.in (if using BR2_EXTERNAL)
+-- external.mk (if using BR2_EXTERNAL)
------

Details on the files shown above are given further in this chapter.

Note: if you choose to place this structure outside of the Buildroot
tree using +BR2_EXTERNAL+, the <company> and possibly <boardname>
components may be superfluous and can be left out.
