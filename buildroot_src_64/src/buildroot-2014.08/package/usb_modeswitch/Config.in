	  Some models of some USB devices such as modems and Wifi
	  adapters power-up in mass storage mode to provide access to
	  drivers for the device's application mode. usb_modeswitch
	  changes the mode of such devices from the initial power-up
	  mode to the application mode. Specific configuration data
	  for each device model is required.

	  usb_modeswitch can be used with the usb_modeswitch_data
	  package and udev for automatic mode switching when devices
	  are connected.

	  For more information search the Internet for "Virtual CD-ROM
	  switching utility".
