A test which checks the following types of
memory accesses using a simple march algorithm.
	- to cacheable pages
	- to non-cacheable pages
	- bypasses.

There are two ways to test this

	SMALLMEM
		Using the AJIT VC709 prototype with 4MB
		of RAM startng at physical address 0x0

	BIGMEM
		Using the AJIT KC705 prototype with 16MB
		Flash starting at 0x0, and 128MB DRAM starting
		at 0x40000000+
