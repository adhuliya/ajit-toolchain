Run the following steps to setup the docker image and run it

    -   ./dockbuild
        this creates an image with all the necessary packages and 
        base as ubuntu:16.04
    -   ./dockrun.sh
        this is a script for starting and running the docker image we created 
        in the previous step. When successfully run, you will be in your  host 
        home director,y but within the container. Same user name, group and accesses 
        as your host system is setup in the container for convenience. 
        Execute 'exit' twice to exit the running container.
