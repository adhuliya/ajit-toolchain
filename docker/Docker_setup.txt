Note: Tested to work on ubuntu machines. 

This raedme explains the steps to setup docker with ajit-toolchain. 


1. Importing a docker image.
	Please download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18erSMxMXyPrAFdkIr9ntFrDeU4PPn0s1/view?usp=sharing

	This will give you a file 'ajit_base.tar'. After downloading, run the following command to import the docker image -
       	docker load -i ajit_base.tar;
       
       
2. Now we need the whole ajit-toolchain directory.
	1. If you are unable to clone from git -	
	The latest pre-built ajit-toolchain zipfile - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i1aU6TUkJaxAUp5C2kirYXXxndxvlJ8D/view?usp=sharing


	2. From the repository directory, do the following -

	# STEP 1: build a development docker image
	cd docker/ajit_build_dev;
	./build.sh; # this builds a new docker image over the ajit_base image downloaded earlier.

	# STEP 2: run the docker container
	./run.sh;

	# STEP 3: attach a shell to the docker container and setup the toolchain. 
	./attach_shell.sh;
	source ./set_sjit_home
	./setup.sh

	You can now use the complete ajit system from this shell.
