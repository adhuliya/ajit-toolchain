This raedme explains the steps to setup docker with ajit-toolchain. 


1. Importing a docker image.
	Please download: https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ck2jSq8LTO-q2RFrwc49mPkXTH9LecVx

	This will give you a file 'ajit_build_dev.tar'. After downloading, run the following command to import the docker image -
       	docker load -i ajit_build_dev.tar;
       
       
2. Now we need the whole ajit-toolchain directory.
	
	1. From the repository directory, do the following -
	
	#STEP 1: Go to ajit_build_dev directory - 
	cd docker/ajit_build_dev

	# STEP 2: Remove any container named ajit_build_dev - 
	docker rm --force ajit_build_dev;
	
	# STEP 3: run the docker container
	docker run --detach --name ajit_build_dev -v $(dirname $(dirname $(pwd))):/home/ajit/ajit-toolchain ajit_build_dev:1.0

	# STEP 3: attach a shell to the docker container and setup the toolchain. 
	docker exec -u $(id -nu) -w /home/ajit/ajit-toolchain -it ajit_build_dev  /bin/bash;
	source ./set_ajit_home
	./setup.sh

	You can now use the complete ajit system from this shell.
